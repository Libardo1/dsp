[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

Exercise 1   In the BRFSS (see Section 5.4), the distribution of heights is roughly normal with parameters µ = 178 cm and σ = 7.7 cm for men, and µ = 163 cm and σ = 7.3 cm for women.
In order to join Blue Man Group, you have to be male between 5’10” and 6’1” (see http://bluemancasting.com). What percentage of the U.S. male population is in this range? Hint: use scipy.stats.norm.cdf.

```python
import scipy.stats

mu = 178
sigma = 7.7
dist = scipy.stats.norm(loc=mu, scale=sigma)
type(dist)

print(dist.mean(), dist.std())

print(dist.cdf(mu - sigma))

low = dist.cdf(177.8)  #5'10"
high = dist.cdf(185.4)  #6'1"
print("{0:.0%} of men are 5 ft 10 in or under.".format(low), 
"{0:.0%} of men are 6 ft 1 in or under.".format(high),
"{0:.0%} of men are between 5 ft 10 in and 6 ft 1 in.".format(high - low))
#scipy.stats.norm represents a local distribution
