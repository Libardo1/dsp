[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)
Exercise 5   In the repository for this book, youâ€™ll find a set of data files called mystery0.dat, mystery1.dat, and so on. Each contains a sequence of random numbers generated from an analytic distribution.
You will also find test_models.py, a script that reads data from a file and plots the CDF under a variety of transforms. You can run it like this:
```python
$ python test_models.py mystery0.dat
```
Based on these plots, you should be able to infer what kind of distribution generated each file. If you are stumped, you can look in mystery.py, which contains the code that generated the files.
