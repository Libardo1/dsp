[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)
Exercise 1   Using data from the NSFG, make a scatter plot of birth weight versus mother’s age. Plot percentiles of birth weight versus mother’s age. Compute Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlations. How would you characterize the relationship between these variables?

In this exercise, I created a scatter plot that graphs the mothers age as x and the baby;s weight as y. At the same time, I ran the regular correlation and the Spearman correlation separately as values to get a numeric indication of whether or not there is an implied correlation. The correlation is .068 and the Spearman correlation is .095, indicating that there isn't a strong correlation. Additionally, the scatter plot implies a line almost parallel to the x axis, with a distribution of 6-8.5 pounds regardless of the mother's age.  

I used the formulas for Correlation, Covariance and Spearman correlation from thinkstats2 as guides to write the code for this exercise. I would like to eventually not import thinkstats2 for CDF, but have yet to extract that class as it calls on several other large formulas within that file.
