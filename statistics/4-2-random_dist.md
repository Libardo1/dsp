[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)
Exercise 2   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

I imported the random module and ran it for 1000 random numbers (in range(1000)). When I used thinkplot to create a PMF of the distribution, it was essentially unreadable with a seemingly random distribution of many (1000, one would hope) lines. The CDF for the distribution was a near perfect diagonal line, indicating that all numbers within the range (0,1) have an equal probability of being selected by the random module. This also explains why the PMF was unreadable - if all numbers are equally likely, the PMF will not display a curve to speak of. 


``` python
import random
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot


def randm():
	rand2 = [random.random() for _ in range(1000)]
	cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand2)
	thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
	thinkplot.Show()
	#pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand2)
	#thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=.1)
	#thinkplot.Show()
randm()
