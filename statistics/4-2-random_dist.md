[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)
Exercise 2   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

``` python
import random
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot


def randm():
	rand2 = [random.random() for _ in range(1000)]
	cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand2)
	thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
	thinkplot.Show()
	#pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand2)
	#thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=.1)
	#thinkplot.Show()
randm()
