[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

I added the print statements at the end of the program to denote whether or not the effect is large. 


'''python
import math
import nsfg
import first

def WeightDifference(live, firsts, others):
    mean0 = live.totalwgt_lb.mean()
    mean1 = firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean()
    mean2 = others.totalwgt_lb.mean()

    var1 = firsts.totalwgt_lb.var()
    var2 = others.totalwgt_lb.var()

def CohenEffectSize(group1, group2):
    diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()

    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    n1, n2 = len(group1), len(group2)

    pooled_var = (n1 * var1 + n2 * var2) / (n1 + n2)
    d = diff / math.sqrt(pooled_var)
    return(d)
def main():
    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    WeightDifference(live, firsts, others)
    group1 = firsts.total_lb()
    group2 = others.totalwgt_lb()
    d = CohenEffectSize(group1, group2)
    print("Cohen D", d)
    if d > .49:
        print("The effect size is large")
    if d > .29:
        print("The effect size is medium")
    else: 
        print("the effect size is small")   
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
