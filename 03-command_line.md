# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

> > _cd_ - change directory gets you one down in folder paths. Cannot be used to go back in folder path. cd .. gets you up one folder in path
rmdir - deletes a folder directly below the one you're in [rmdir <folder name>]. cannot be used to delete folders that have any contents
ls - used below cd to list all folders and files in a folder - good for rmdir or further cd
mkdir - makes a new folder in folder you are in
pwd - shows you where you are in a path
pushd/popd - pushd is like temp cd into a path, then type popd to move back to original folder. can push into further folders and pop back several times to get to original directory
touch - creates empty file in directory
